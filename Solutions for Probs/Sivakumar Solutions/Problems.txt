2. write a code to generate fibanocci series

3. 1! = 1
   2! = 2
 145! = 1! + 4! + 5!
      = 1  + 24 + 120
      = 145
  ?

what is the next number which satisfies this condition

4. write a code to generate pascals triangle

           1 1
          1 2 1
         1 3 3 1

5. (greedy ? )
	farmer -> 3 daughters -> each daughter had a son
        farmer had  mangoes in a room
        farmer promisses his daughters that he is going distribute mangoes to them equally in the evening after his shopping.
        In the absence of the father 1st daughter enters the room without the knowledge of her siblings
	She makes three divisions of the available mangoes in the room and 1 mango was extra she gives that to her child, takes 1 division(heap) and mixes other two divsions and leaves the room.
	Now 2nd daughter same idea and same execution
	Now 2rd daughter same idea and same execution
       Finally the father enters the room and finds some mangoes and distributes it as he promised.

  how many mangoes were there in the room? num1,num2,num3

Generate 5 such numbers


fst dt -> 3 parts -> 1 mango extra
sec dt -> 3 parts -> 1 mango extra
trd dt -> 3 parts -> 1 mango extra

farmer -> 3 equal parts no reminders

find 5 such numbers


6. generate armstrong numbers between 1 and 500
   153 = 1 ** 3 + 5 ** 3 + 3 ** 3
       = 1 + 125 + 27
       = 153
